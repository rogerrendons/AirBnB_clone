## Description of the project
HBNB is a project that allows us to know how the creation of a WEB is from its beginning, in this first part it begins with the construction of **THE CONSOLE**, where we will have a shell with the basic commands for the control of file information.

This is used to command-line manage the information required for optimal functionality, In the main functionalities it is:

 - Creation of new BaseModel and User objects
 - Recovering BaseModel and Users from a file
 - Destroy the object, such as delete functionality.

### Scope of the project
The following diagram shows the scope of the first part of this project.

Mainly the creation of the console begins where it will be connected through JSON to a storage to have the ability to save and retrieve information.

# How to start it
To start the console, just type in the command line of the main shell of your operating system the command:
``` console.py ```

You will see this when you enter the console:

# How to use it
## Commands
Command | Description | Usage
-------- | ----------- |-------- |
**help**| Show commands. | **help**
**quit**     | Exit program. | **quit**
**create**  | Create instance.| **create** \<class\>
**show**    | Print representation instance class & id | **show** \<class - id\>
**destroy** | Delete instance | **destroy** \<class - id\>
**all** | Prints all information instances | **all** \<class - id\>
**update** | Updates information in class name and id | **update** \<class - id - key - value\>

For more information, check the examples below.

## Examples
### Help
in the example you will find the console start word $ ./console.py,
In it you can enter a command that allows the help of the commands that can be performed.
Typing help and the command you want will receive help for this command to be used.
``` 
$ ./console.py 
(hbnb)
(hbnb)help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  create  destroy  help  quit  show

(hbnb)help quit
Quit - Exit console
(hbnb)
(hbnb)help show
Prints string representation instance based on the class name
(hbnb)
(hbnb)help destroy
Delete instance based on class name and id
(hbnb)
```
### Exit console
A simple command to return to the operating system shell, "quit", this allows you to exit the console.
```
(hbnb)
(hbnb)quit
virtual@DESKTOP:~/AirBnB_clone$ 
```
## Create BaseModel
With the command "create BaseModel" you can create a new model that is saved in the file by means of JSON.
```
(hbnb)create BaseModel
3f7606ff-e5f5-4d5a-8148-829674c353e9
(hbnb)
```
## Show Base Model
With the command "show BaseModel <id-model>" you can retrieve the information stored in the BaseModel file saved in the file.
```
(hbnb)show BaseModel 3f7606ff-e5f5-4d5a-8148-829674c353e9
[BaseModel] (3f7606ff-e5f5-4d5a-8148-829674c353e9) {'id': '3f7606ff-e5f5-4d5a-8148-829674c353e9', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 30, 12, 55, 35, 572984), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 30, 12, 55, 35, 573010)}
(hbnb)
```
## Destroy Base Model
With the command "destroy BaseModel <id-model>" you can delete the information stored in the BaseModel file.
```
(hbnb)destroy BaseModel 3f7606ff-e5f5-4d5a-8148-829674c353e9
(hbnb)
```
Now again with "show BaseModel <id-model> you can check if this was removed."
```
(hbnb)show BaseModel 3f7606ff-e5f5-4d5a-8148-829674c353e9
** no instance found **
(hbnb)
```
it was effectively removed from the file.
## All Base Model
With the command "all BaseModel" the information stored in the file is obtained.
if it is empty the following is observed
```
(hbnb)all BaseModel
[]
(hbnb)
```
now let's see with information stored with 3 BaseModel
```
(hbnb)create BaseModel
95fefb0d-d73a-42f0-82cb-782708cfd6af
(hbnb)create BaseModel
686e4d9d-4255-4e73-bc09-98c189f8495f
(hbnb)create BaseModel
ba42431a-3f3d-45f4-9385-dadb5aa24667
(hbnb)
(hbnb)all BaseModel
["[BaseModel] (95fefb0d-d73a-42f0-82cb-782708cfd6af) {'id': '95fefb0d-d73a-42f0-82cb-782708cfd6af', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 30, 13, 19, 56, 553920), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 30, 13, 19, 56, 553955)}", "[BaseModel] (686e4d9d-4255-4e73-bc09-98c189f8495f) {'id': '686e4d9d-4255-4e73-bc09-98c189f8495f', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 30, 13, 19, 58, 617067), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 30, 13, 19, 58, 617088)}", "[BaseModel] (ba42431a-3f3d-45f4-9385-dadb5aa24667) {'id': 'ba42431a-3f3d-45f4-9385-dadb5aa24667', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 30, 13, 19, 59, 288827), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 30, 13, 19, 59, 288848)}"]
(hbnb)
```
## Update Base Model
To update the information of one of the models is done with the command "update BaseModel <id-model>", in the following one of the models will be updated with the first_name "Juan".
```
(hbnb)
(hbnb)update BaseModel 95fefb0d-d73a-42f0-82cb-782708cfd6af first_name "Juan"
(hbnb)
```
now with the command "show BaseModel <id-model>" we can see how it has been updated, also see how it looks with all models.
```
(hbnb)show BaseModel 95fefb0d-d73a-42f0-82cb-782708cfd6af
[BaseModel] (95fefb0d-d73a-42f0-82cb-782708cfd6af) {'id': '95fefb0d-d73a-42f0-82cb-782708cfd6af', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 30, 13, 19, 56, 553920), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 30, 13, 19, 56, 553955), 'first_name': '"Juan"'}
(hbnb)
```
